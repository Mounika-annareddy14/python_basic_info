# Python_Basic_Info:-

Here are some basic information and key features of Python:

Basic Info:

- Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991
- Released in 1994
- Latest version: Python 3.x (Python 2.x is still used, but 3.x is the recommended version)

Key Features:

- High-level language: Abstracts away low-level details, making it easier to focus on logic and syntax
- Interpreted language: Code is executed line-by-line, without the need for compilation
- Object-oriented: Organizes code into objects and classes, promoting modularity and reuse
- Dynamic typing: Variable types are determined at runtime, rather than at compile time
- Indentation-based syntax: Uses spaces or tabs to define code blocks, rather than curly braces or keywords
- Large standard library: Includes modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data analysis

Basic Syntax:

- Variables: Assign values using the assignment operator (=)
- Data types: Includes strings, integers, floats, lists, dictionaries, and more
- Operators: Supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more
- Control structures: Includes if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and try-except blocks


VARIABLES:-

           Variables! In programming and mathematics, a variable is a symbol that represents a value that can change or vary. It's a container that holds a value, and the value can be changed or updated as needed.

        For example, in the equation "x = 5", "x" is the variable, and "5" is the value assigned to it. You can then use the variable "x" in other equations or operations, and its value will be used in the calculation.
    Eg:-
    a=5
    print(a)

RULES:    

      1. Unique names: Variable names must be unique and distinct from other variables, constants, and reserved words.
      2. Assignment: A variable can be assigned a value using the assignment operator (=).
      3. Data type: Variables have a specific data type (e.g., number, string, boolean), which determines the type of value they can hold.
      4. Scope: Variables have a scope, which defines where they can be accessed and used.
      5. Case sensitivity: Variable names are often case-sensitive, meaning "x" and "X" are treated as different variables.
      6. No spaces: Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters (except for underscores or other language-specific characters).
      7. No reserved words: Variable names cannot be reserved words or keywords in the programming language.
      8. ** Declaration**: In some languages, variables must be declared before use, while in others, they can be implicitly declared by assignment.
      9. Reassignment: Variables can be reassigned a new value, which overwrites the previous value.
      10. Usage: Variables are used to store and manipulate values in equations, expressions, and statements.





DATA TYPES:

    Data types! In programming and computer science, a data type is a classification of data that determines the type of value a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.

Data types are important because they:

- Determine the type of operations that can be performed on a value.
- Affect the amount of memory allocated to store a value.
- Influence the format of input and output data.
- Help catch errors and improve code reliability.
